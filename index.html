### 1. 感官使役动词的被动语态  
----

#### 常见动词：

##### 感官动词：

- **see** √
- **hear** √
- notice
- watch
- observe

##### 使役动词：

- **make** √
- let
- observe

----

#### 为什么要特别讲呢？

- 都是用法闹的！
- 来看两个例句：
	- The teacher **made** the students __ __  (stay) after class for extra work
	- - They **saw** the children __ __ (play) in the park.
-  Sum up: 感官动词/使役动词 + do (动词原形)
	- 本质其实是省略了to 
		- **make** the students **(to) stay**
		- **see** the children **(to) play**

----

#### 怎么还原？

- 把落下的【**to**】还回去！
- 结构说明
  - 主动语态：主语 + make + 宾语 + 动词原形（do）
  - 被动语态：宾语 + be made + to + 动词原形（do） + by + 主语
- 举个例子：
- 例句1：
- 主动语态：She makes him clean the room.
- 被动语态：
----
- step 1: 动词变成被动：make → is made
- step 2: 在后面跟上原句里面 him 做的事情：clean the room
- step 3: 记得补上 to
- Ans： He is made <u>to</u> clean the room by her.
- hear/see这些感官动词也是同理，我们就不多说了x
